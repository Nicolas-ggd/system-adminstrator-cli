# System Administrator CLI
## ⚙️ Project Overview:
The goal is to create a
tool that automates system administration tasks, making life easier for sysadmins. This could be a command-line interface (CLI) application
that helps with monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting systems.

## 🌟 Project goals
Building a System Administrator Tool is an excellent way to apply Go skills to real-world problems. This project is a testing application to explore new possibilities and gain more knowledge in Go. Let's see what happens in the future!

## 🔨 Features to Consider:
1. System Monitoring: Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and network traffic.
2. Alerting and Notifications: Send alerts when thresholds are exceeded (e.g., or running scripts. CPU usage > 80% or when specific events occur (e.g., a service crashes)).

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries:
1. Go's os/exec package: For running shell commands, executing scripts, or automating tasks.
